# AppConfigurator

As simple as possible - open app.config, edit, and save!

## Getting started
After building the app, start the AppConfigurator.exe and select the app.config file you want to load. 
You can open any file you want, as long as it is using a standard app.config .NET format.  
Tabs for each config section will be created, and each setting will have an editor assigned, based on type. 
This way, switching configuration entries on production or test environments will become faster and easier. 

List of available editors:

* Color picker for Hex colors
* Date and time picker for DateTime
* Numeric spin editor for numeric data types
* Checkbox for bool values
* Textbox for strings
